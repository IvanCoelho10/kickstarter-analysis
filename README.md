# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project

In the first activity carried out, it was done to analyze the projects that were launched and that were successful or not. The deadline for each funded campaign and the time and amount spent on each one.

### Purpose
The purpose of this view was to track which campaign was successful, which campaign was canceled, or which one did not meet expectations.

## Analysis and Challenges

My main challenge was how to add the functions of each column and how to read the Plot area and outliers, through Canvas I was able to identify and make a better reading about the topic.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1- The first analysis that can be done is that the campaigns carried out in May were more successful than in the other months of the year.

2- Canceled projects maintained regularity throughout the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The percentage of success of projects with a goal up to 9999 had a greater success, considering that these projects represent 85% of the total projects.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Projects with higher costs have a very high failure percentage.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1- We can identify the most successful Parent category.

2- We can identify the projects that had a higher percentage of donations.

3- We can separate the outcomes by country to know the amount invested in each one.
